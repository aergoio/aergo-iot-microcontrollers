# Aergo IoT - microcontrollers

This repository contains some examples on interfacing with the aergo blockchain from microcontrollers

The ESP32 is the first supported microcontroller but others can be supported on demand

If your company or institution has special requirements, feel comfortable to contact us!

## Security

Microcontrollers that have support for security features at the hardware level are the most secure devices!

For 2 reasons:

1. They do not have a big OS (high probability of backdoors or bugs)

2. The private key is protected

## Use cases

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/aergoio/aergo-iot-microcontrollers/wiki/Use-cases) for some suggestions
